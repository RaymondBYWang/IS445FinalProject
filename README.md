Professor Uhe

IS445 -Data Visualization

Final Project

Biggest Takeaway from this class:
Undoubtedly, as a course of data visualization, the biggest gain of this course is that we can master how to manipulate and visualize data. 
First of all, we systematically studied different data visualization tools and technologies, such as matplotlib, bqplot, vega-lite and D3. 
In this process, we not only improved our programming skills, but also deeply understood many fields of data visualization. 
Not only that, in this class, we emphasize practical operation, which gives us an opportunity to examine, criticize and improve the existing data visualization, so as to better understand the expression and transmission of data. 
In addition, we also help us to enhance our critical thinking and creative thinking through the weekly visualization report, so that we can interpret and use the data more effectively.

Things Professor Uhe could improve on as a teacherï¼š
There is no doubt that you are an excellent professor. Your teaching process and teaching methods in the classroom have benefited us a lot, and let us learn how to use python for visual analysis. 
I think the only thing worth improving is to keep you healthy, so that we can enjoy more interesting classes.
